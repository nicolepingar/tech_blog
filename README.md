# Tech Blog

## Description

I have created a tech blog where developers can publish blog posts and comment on other developers' blog posts. I have created this full-stack web application following the MVC paradigm. I used Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Installation

To install please run the following commands:

        npm i

To install and seed the database, please run the following command:

        node seeds/index.js

To start the server, please run the following command:

        node server.js
